# Week 1 ‚Äì Lab Setup & Connectivity Testing  

## Lab Environment  

For the first week I focused on building the base lab environment. I spun up three VMs inside VirtualBox:  

- **Kali Linux** ‚Äì my attack box and main analysis machine  
- **Ubuntu Server** ‚Äì used as a target and web server  
- **Windows 10** ‚Äì client machine for testing  

Networking was set up with two adapters:  
- **Host-Only (192.168.56.0/24)** ‚Äì lets the VMs talk to each other and keeps the traffic isolated from my home network.  
- **NAT Network (10.0.2.0/24)** ‚Äì gives internet access so I can install packages and updates.

## Step 1 ‚Äì Checking IP Addresses  

First thing was to make sure each VM actually got an IP address on the host-only network.  

- On Kali/Ubuntu:  
```bash
ip addr show
```  
- On Windows:  
```powershell
ipconfig
```  

Each machine showed up with a `192.168.56.x` address, and Ubuntu also pulled a `10.0.2.x` from the NAT side.

## Step 2 ‚Äì Testing Connectivity  

### Ping  
At first Kali couldn‚Äôt ping Windows (100% packet loss). Turned out Windows firewall blocks ICMP by default. After enabling the inbound Echo Request rule, pings worked both ways.

### SSH into Ubuntu  
Installed OpenSSH on Ubuntu:  
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install openssh-server -y
```  

From Kali I could then connect with:  
```bash
ssh <ubuntu-user>@192.168.56.102
```  

Got the password prompt which confirmed SSH was working.

### Apache Web Server  
Next I installed Apache on Ubuntu:  
```bash
sudo apt-get install apache2 -y
sudo systemctl enable apache2
sudo systemctl start apache2
```  

From Windows, I browsed to:  
```
http://192.168.56.102
```  

After some tweaking (making sure Apache was listening on `*:80` and not just `127.0.0.1`), the default ‚ÄúIt works!‚Äù page came up.

## Step 3 ‚Äì Capturing Traffic with Wireshark  

On Kali I fired up Wireshark and watched traffic flow between the machines.  

- Ping tests ‚Üí filter `icmp`  
- SSH session ‚Üí filter `tcp.port == 22`  
- Apache request ‚Üí filter `tcp.port == 80`  

It was cool to see the raw packets from actions I triggered.

## Step 4 ‚Äì Troubleshooting Notes  

A few things went wrong along the way:  

- **Kali couldn‚Äôt ping Windows** ‚Üí fixed by enabling Windows firewall ICMP rule.  
- **Ubuntu couldn‚Äôt install packages** ‚Üí fixed by adding a second NAT adapter and updating Netplan.  
- **Windows browser said ‚Äúconnection refused‚Äù** ‚Üí checked with `ss -tuln | grep :80`, saw Apache listening properly, then allowed it through UFW.
