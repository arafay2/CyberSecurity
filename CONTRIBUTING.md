# Contributing Guidelines  

This portfolio is part of a 12-week cybersecurity learning journey.  

- Each weekâ€™s documentation is in a `.md` file.  
- Screenshots should go into the corresponding `/WeekX_screenshots/` folder.  
- Use Markdown image links to reference screenshots, e.g.:  
  `![Description](Week1_screenshots/my_screenshot.png)`  

This structure keeps the repo clean and easy to navigate.
